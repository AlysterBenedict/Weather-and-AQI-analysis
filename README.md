Project Description:

Title: Comparative Analysis of Air Quality and Weather Patterns in Urban Centers

Overview:
This project aims to conduct a comparative analysis of air quality, weather conditions, and AQI (Air Quality Index) levels between two major cities using data visualization techniques. Through the visualization of pollutant levels, weather parameters, and AQI indices over a specific period, this study intends to provide insights into the environmental dynamics and potential health impacts associated with air pollution in urban settings.

Data Sources:
The project utilizes CSV files containing historical data on pollutants, weather conditions, and AQI indices for the selected cities. Additional CSV files for supplementary cities can be incorporated for broader comparative analysis.

Visualizations:
1. Comparative Pollutant Levels:
   - Line plots generated using Plotly, depicting variations in key pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2) over time for each city.

2. Weather Conditions:
   - Line plots generated using Plotly, showcasing trends in weather parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed) over the study period for both cities.

3. AQI Trends:
   - Bar plots generated using Plotly, illustrating AQI trends over the study period for both cities, highlighting peak pollution episodes.

4. Saturation Level Analysis:
   - Radar charts demonstrating the saturation levels of pollutants in the air, allowing for a holistic assessment of air quality.
   - Pie charts illustrating the proportion of time spent in different AQI categories (e.g., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy) for each city.

Additional Features:
- Interactive dashboard: Incorporating dropdown menus or sliders to enable users to select specific pollutants, timeframes, or cities for visualization.
- Statistical analysis: Conducting correlation analyses or hypothesis testing to explore relationships between pollutant levels, weather conditions, and AQI indices.
- Predictive modeling: Employing machine learning algorithms to forecast future air quality trends based on historical data.

Conclusion:
Through comprehensive data visualization and analysis, this project endeavors to offer valuable insights into the environmental and public health implications of air pollution in urban areas. By comparing multiple cities and examining various factors influencing air quality, stakeholders can make informed decisions to mitigate pollution and promote sustainable development strategies.
